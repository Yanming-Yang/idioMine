,,LocalResourceStatusProtoOrBuilder p = viaProto ? proto : builder;,"Yes, that code pattern looks like a Java code pattern for implementing the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) API.

In protobuf, messages are defined in a .proto file, which is compiled into Java code to generate message classes. For each message class, a corresponding builder class is also generated, which is used to construct instances of the message class.

The LocalResourceStatusProtoOrBuilder class is likely a generated builder interface for a protobuf message with the same name. The viaProto boolean is used to determine whether the builder should manipulate a proto instance directly or a builder instance indirectly.

Overall, this pattern is commonly used in protobuf code to build and manipulate message instances.

The code snippet uses conditional logic to check whether a particular field, ""EVENTS"", is present in a list of fields to retrieve called ""fieldsToRetrieve"". If the ""EVENTS"" field is not present in the list, the code adds a filter to a list of filters called ""infoColFamilyList"".

The filter added is created using the utility class TimelineFilterUtils and the HBaseQualifierFilter method. This filter is designed to look for a qualifier (column name) that is NOT_EQUAL to a specific value, which in this case is the SubApplicationColumnPrefix.EVENT value.

The purpose of this code pattern is to add a filter to the filter list that excludes any data with the ""EVENTS"" field, which can be useful for certain types of data processing or analysis."
,,if(this.resourceTracker != null){},
,,ResourceLocalizationSpecProtoOrBuilder p = viaProto ? proto : builder;,"Yes, this is a code pattern commonly used in classes generated by Protocol Buffers.

In this pattern, there are two fields in the class: proto and builder. proto is an instance of the generated Protocol Buffers message class that represents the data in its serialized form, while builder is an instance of the corresponding builder class that allows for the creation and modification of the message.

The viaProto field is a boolean that indicates whether the class has been initialized using a proto instance or a builder instance. When viaProto is true, the class is using the proto instance directly. When viaProto is false, the class is using the builder instance and any changes made to the class will be reflected in the underlying builder instance.

So, in the code pattern ResourceLocalizationSpecProtoOrBuilder p = viaProto ? proto : builder;, the p variable is initialized to either the proto or builder instance depending on the value of viaProto. This allows the class to work seamlessly with both the serialized proto instance and the builder instance used to create and modify the message."

In this pattern, a ContainerId is extracted from the Container object passed as an argument to the method, and a switch statement is used to handle different types of events related to the container.

For example, when the event type is LAUNCH_CONTAINER, a new ContainerLaunch object is created and submitted to a containerLauncher instance to start the container. The ContainerLaunch object is also added to a Map called running to keep track of running containers.

Other types of events, such as PAUSE_CONTAINER and RESUME_CONTAINER, involve retrieving the corresponding ContainerLaunch object from the running map and invoking its methods to perform the desired action.

The code pattern also includes error handling, such as checking if a container is already running or logging exceptions that may occur during container management operations.

Overall, this pattern provides a flexible and extensible way to handle different types of container-related events in a YARN application, allowing for easy customization and management of containers."
