This pattern involves creating a new collection instance and populating it with a predefined set of objects in a single statement, by passing an array or list of objects as an argument to the constructor of the collection class. This helps to save time and effort in initializing the collection and avoids the need for repetitive add statements."

This is a common practice in order to avoid null pointer exceptions and ensure that the code runs smoothly without unexpected errors. The use of a ternary operator or if statement to check for null values before using them is a widely used practice in programming."

Specifically, it utilizes the Stream API to map each element of the list to a new value (in this case, converting an integer to a string) and then collect those new values into a new list. This pattern is frequently used in modern Java code and is considered a best practice for working with collections."

Yes, the synthesized code is a generic Java code snippet that has been occurred in multiple Java libraries. The code snippet is a common way to retrieve postings (i.e., document IDs and frequency information) from an index for a given term. It follows the standard Lucene API which is widely used in Java libraries for information retrieval and search applications."
